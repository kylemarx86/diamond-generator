# Diamond Generator

## Description
This application creates an array of HTML elements that will contain a diamond pattern that can be repeated to form a tessalation. Different branches allow for different patterns of the diamonds. The main pattern consists small diamonds (8 pixels along each diagonal edge) and large diamonds (4 small  diamonds long along each leg) and a background color. The application is intended to allow for quick changes between colors to create multiple images that can be used to create tessalations.

## Branch Notes
Branch names may change but these are the main descriptors.
-*Color on Field* - This branch creates a pattern where the large diamonds are of the main color and are set on a field of small diamonds of a slightly darker color.
-*Black and Color* - This branch creates a field of small black diamonds with large diamonds of the main color.
-*Black, Gray, and Color* - (still to come) Much like the *Black and Color*, this will consist of a field of small black diamonds but will be interspersed with alternating large diamonds of gray and of the main color.
-*Alternating Diamonds* - (still to come) Small pattern consisting only of large diamonds on a main color and large diamonds of a slightly darker shade of the main color.

## More to come
-Sample finished images to help guide which branch to use to create a pattern.
-More patterns.
